A collection of tools for a better camping experience.
The webscraper allows users to find what items they need 
to go camping at the best prices with items that have little or poor reviews being filtered out to ensure the best camping experience.
The checklist influences what information is displayed as items that are checked off are assumed to already be owned by the user
and thus providing product suggestions is not necessary. The openAI image generator takes a user provided term or terms and generates
a camping themed photo of the term or terms. The more terms a user inputs the more images they will have generated. Generated images
are sent to a phone via text message. The tools to manage and generate crypto wallets are inlcuded in the file but were not used
in the final version.
